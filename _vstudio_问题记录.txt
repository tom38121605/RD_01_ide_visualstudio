	 - CNCTestApplicationInstaller, "D:\cnctestapp\cnctestapplication-1.3.1\CNCTestApplicationInstaller\CNCTestApplicationInstaller.vdproj"

分析： 实际上出现此问题的原因是没有安装这个Installer打包工具
解决： 点击ok即可，不影响其它功能的使用。   （待验证）


2. 全部重新编译 CNCTestApplication,出现下面的提示
   The referenced component 'System.Buffers' could not be found.
解决： 把C:\workspace\cnctestapp_20231205_0995中的 System.Buffers.dll，拷贝到C:\Windows\SysWOW64中，再编译该warning消失  （待继续测试）
补充： 同时， 另外几个warning也消失了， 如'System.Memory，Google.Protobuf， 其他的只剩下Ivi.Visa.Interop


3. 全部重新编译 CNCTestApplication,出现下面的提示
   The referenced component 'Ivi.Visa.Interop' could not be found.
解决： 在National Instruments官网 https://lumen.ni.com/nicif/create.xhtml
zhao 下载 visal的驱动，然后管理员安装，安装时去掉病毒防护，即ok


5. 在安装ni-visa 的驱动文件 ni-visa_24.8_online.exe 时， 提示下面的错误信息
    An error occurred while attempting to create the directory: C:\Users\Public\Documents\National Instruments
解决：  打开windows安全中心 -- 病毒和威胁防护设置 -- 管理设置  -- 把实时保护，云保护，篡改防护都设置为关闭


6. 在打开cnctestapp时，在主界面出现下面的错误提示
